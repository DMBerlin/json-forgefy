# Changelog

## [4.0.0](https://github.com/DMBerlin/json-forgefy/compare/v3.2.0...v4.0.0) (2025-10-17)

### üéâ Major Release: Array Transformation & Date Operations

This major release introduces powerful array transformation operators and comprehensive date handling capabilities, bringing json-forgefy to feature parity with MongoDB's aggregation pipeline for common use cases.

### ‚ö† BREAKING CHANGES

* **operators:** Array operators (`$map`, `$filter`, `$reduce`) have a documented limitation - they cannot be nested within object properties due to JavaScript module circular dependencies. Use them at expression root level instead. See README for workarounds.

### ‚ú® Features

#### **Array Transformation Operators**
* **$map**: Transform each element in an array with expressions
  - Full execution context support (`$current`, `$index`)
  - Complex nested expressions ($cond, $switch, math operators)
  - Fallback support for error handling
  - 43 comprehensive tests, 100% coverage
  
* **$filter**: Filter array elements based on conditions
  - Support for complex conditions ($and, $or, $cond)
  - Execution context variables (`$current`, `$index`)
  - 41 tests covering all scenarios
  
* **$reduce**: Aggregate array to single value
  - Full context support (`$accumulated`, `$current`, `$index`)
  - Complex aggregations with $switch, $cond
  - 48 tests including real-world use cases

#### **Array Utility Operators**
* **$arrayFirst**: Get first array element with fallback
* **$arrayLast**: Get last array element with fallback
* **$arrayAt**: Get element at index (supports negative indexing)
* **$sum**: Sum numeric array values (filters non-numeric)
* **$avg**: Calculate average of numeric values (filters non-numeric)
  - Total: 230 tests across 5 utility operators

#### **Date Operations**
* **$toDate**: Convert and validate dates (ISO-8601, timestamps, Date objects)
* **$dayOfWeek**: Extract day of week (0-6, Sunday-Saturday)
* **$dayOfMonth**: Extract day of month (1-31)
* **$dayOfYear**: Extract day of year (1-366, leap year aware)
* **$isWeekend**: Check if date is weekend (customizable weekends)
* **$isHoliday**: Check if date is in holiday list
* **$addDays**: Add/subtract days from date
* **$dateShift**: Shift date to next/previous business day
  - Strategies: rollForward, rollBackward, keep
  - Holiday and custom weekend support
  - DST-aware with timezone support

#### **Advanced Math**
* **$mod**: Modulo/remainder operation
* **$pow**: Power/exponentiation
* **$sqrt**: Square root with fallback for negative numbers
* **$trunc**: Truncate to integer

#### **Enhanced String Operations**
* **$ltrim**: Trim characters from start

* Eliminated 148 lines of duplicate validation code across operators
* Comprehensive 91-test suite for validation helpers
* All array operators now use centralized validation

#### **Fallback System**
* Universal fallback support across math, array, and date operators
* Fallback can be static values, path references, or expressions
* Graceful error handling with descriptive error messages

#### **Infrastructure**
* Timezone helpers with Intl.DateTimeFormat caching
* Date validation helpers (parseDate, formatDateISO, isLeapYear)
* Business day helpers (reused across date operators)
* Custom error types for better debugging

### üìä Statistics

* **+8 array operators** with 408 tests
* **+9 date operators** with extensive test coverage
* **+9 enhanced operators** (math, string, type checking)
* **Total: 77 operators** (from 51 in v3.2.0)
* **1708 tests passing** (6 skipped for documented limitations)
* **100% code coverage** maintained across all metrics
* **Zero dependencies** - pure JavaScript/TypeScript

### üß™ Testing
